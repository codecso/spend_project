    <p>Our company was created with the intent to help users maintain a record of their transactions and purchases so they can make better financial decisions.
      <br>
      <em>Spend</em> was made over the course of a weekend as an individual project with CodeClan.
      <br>
      There were many trials and tribulations across the way, but the process allowed the learning of concepts and design issues which will be valuable for the rest of time.
      <br>
      By using <em>Spend</em>, you not only save money along the way by keeping a record of your transactions but you help to maintain a world of less consumption.
